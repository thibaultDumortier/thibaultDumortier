Hi there ! <br/>
I'm Thibault Dumortier, a french guy working in computer science (bachelor's degree). <br/>
Thanks for coming here to see my GitHub !

### Projects
- Java image compiler: compiles a directory of images into 1 image
- Rust image compiler: like the java one but 8x faster on average
- Rust_Moc_gui: created during an apprentice ship at the Astronomical Observatory of Strasbourg. A gui enabling a user to realise operation on MOCs.

You can reach me on Linked In if needed.
