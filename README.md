Hi there 
I'm Thibault Dumortier, a french student in computer science at the Robert-schuman IUT.
Ty for coming here to see my GitHub.

### I rarely post projects
You can check out the small image compilers I made for fun (I mostly use them as a fun project to discover a language)

You can reach me on Linked In if needed
